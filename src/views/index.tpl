The overall purpose of the Re-CAP Analysis Tool is to assist Principal Systems Ltd. to gain a detailed understanding of your operational requirements, and possible WMS system requirments. 
<br><br>
The Re-Cap tool aims to gather the required information about your operation scale, volumes & complexity to enable us provide you with an outline of what we can deliver and budgetary costs.
<br><br>
In-DEX our WMS software is a functionally rich and scaleable product - a small, single user, paper based, non complex site can be deployed in a matter of days but a large high volume multi-site operation with complex handling and storage rules, fully interfacing to many ERP systems can be 00's days 
<br><br>
We ask a number of questions before and during our initial sales visits to allow us accurately and efficiently assess your needs and thereby providing accurate costs against our deliverables 
<br><br>
Given the varied nature of warehouses, and warehouse activities, one questionnaire cannot be designed to cover every eventuality, some operations are full pallet movements, some are variable weighted case movements etc. 
<br><br>
Your assistance in helping us complete the template below will ensure that accurate budgetary costs will be attained, with no surprises further into the process and perhaps more importantly provide you with a good understanding of how we will address your specific operational requirements
<br><br>
The General Overview Questions, if answered fully and correctly, should be able to offer you an initial, but accurate overview of deliverables and costs 
<br><br>
The further more detailed Tabs, if answered fully and correctly - either now or at a Phase II, should enable us provide you with a detailed level I scoping document and costs. 
<br><br>
From here we then come on site for a full operational review and discussion
<br><br>
Thank you for the opportunity and we hope that we can work with you in delivering a solution to your requirements
<br><br>
If I can be of any assistance please do not hesitate to contact me directly @ 00 353 87 9794888 or email joe.oshea@principalsystems.com
